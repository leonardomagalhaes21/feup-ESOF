## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

FEUP-reUSE is an innovative mobile application aimed at revolutionizing the trading experience, specifically tailored to the vibrant community of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Porto (FEUP).

Catering to students, faculty members, and staff alike, FEUP-reUSE provides an ideal platform for connecting with potential trade partners within the FEUP community. Whether you're seeking to exchange books, clothing, home appliances, electronics, or educational materials, FEUP-reUSE offers a user-friendly interface reminiscent of Instagram, streamlining the trading process and making it both effortless and enjoyable.

It's worth highlighting that FEUP-reUSE operates solely on a donation basis, ensuring that transactions involve no monetary exchange. This fosters a spirit of generosity and community within FEUP, further enhancing the app's appeal and promoting a collaborative trading environment.


### Features and Assumptions

- **Publication System**: Easily create and share posts featuring photos and detailed descriptions of items for trade in the following categories: Books, Clothing, Home Appliances, Electronics, Educational Materials and Miscellaneous.
- **Chat Functionality**: Engage in seamless negotiations and trades with other users through our integrated chat feature, facilitating smooth communication and deal-making. When a user shows interest in an item, they can open a chat with the seller, without the item becoming reserved. It remains the responsibility of the individuals involved to manage the availability of the item during conversation.
- **Rating System**: Rate and review trade partners to share your trading experience and help build a trustworthy community.

### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module. 
Also provide a short textual description of each concept (domain class). 

Example:
 <p align="center" justify="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/templates/blob/main/images/DomainModel.png"/>

## Architecture and Design


### Logical architecture

### Physical architecture

In this subsection, we provide an overview of the physical structure of the Feup-reUSE software system using a UML deployment diagram (Deployment View).

Feup-reUSE is deployed on the user's smartphone. The application securely stores login data and other user information utilizing Firebase, a robust backend platform. This ensures seamless authentication and data management functionalities.

Moreover, Feup-reUSE has access to the local files stored on the user's smartphone. This access enables the application to upload photos for creating posts and to update the user's profile picture.
