## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

FEUP-reUSE is an innovative mobile application aimed at revolutionizing the trading experience, specifically tailored to the vibrant community of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Porto (FEUP).

Catering to students, faculty members, and staff alike, FEUP-reUSE provides an ideal platform for connecting with potential trade partners within the FEUP community. Whether you're seeking to exchange books, clothing, home appliances, electronics, or educational materials, FEUP-reUSE offers a user-friendly interface reminiscent of Instagram, streamlining the trading process and making it both effortless and enjoyable.

It's worth highlighting that FEUP-reUSE operates solely on a donation basis, ensuring that transactions involve no monetary exchange. This fosters a spirit of generosity and community within FEUP, further enhancing the app's appeal and promoting a collaborative trading environment.


### Features and Assumptions

- **Publication System**: Easily create and share posts featuring photos and detailed descriptions of items for trade in the following categories: Books, Clothing, Home Appliances, Electronics, Educational Materials and Miscellaneous.
- **Chat Functionality**: Engage in seamless negotiations and trades with other users through our integrated chat feature, facilitating smooth communication and deal-making. When a user shows interest in an item, they can open a chat with the seller, without the item becoming reserved. It remains the responsibility of the individuals involved to manage the availability of the item during conversation.
- **Rating System**: Rate and review trade partners to share your trading experience and help build a trustworthy community.  

### Elevator Pitch

Welcome to FEUP-reUSE, the game-changing mobile app designed to transform the trading experience within the vibrant community of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Porto (FEUP).

Imagine a platform where students, faculty, and staff can effortlessly connect to trade items ranging from textbooks to electronics, all in a seamless and enjoyable manner. With FEUP-reUSE, users can easily create and share posts featuring detailed descriptions and photos of their items, browse through a variety of categories, and engage in smooth negotiations through integrated chat functionality.

But what sets FEUP-reUSE apart is its commitment to fostering a spirit of generosity and community. Operating solely on a donation basis, FEUP-reUSE ensures that transactions involve no monetary exchange, promoting a collaborative environment where users can trade with confidence. Join us in revolutionizing the way we trade and connect within the FEUP community with FEUP-reUSE!

### Domain model

A user profile includes the user's name, email address, phone number, and profile picture. Each user can publish multiple products, with each product categorized accordingly. A published product available for trade is termed a "Post," which requires a description and image. Each post is associated with a status indicating its availability. Additionally, users can engage in multiple chats with other traders to facilitate and expedite trades.

## Architecture and Design


### Logical architecture

In this subsection, we document the high-level logical structure of the code (Logical View), using a UML diagram with logical packages.

Our system has three main components:

-User Interface:
The UI component is responsible for user interactions. It communicates user input to the logic component for processing.

-Logic:
The Logic component serves as a mediator between the UI and the database and handles authentication, chat and others.

-Database:
Firebase serves as the backend storage solution, storing user data securely and facilitating real-time data synchronization.

### Physical architecture

In this subsection, we provide an overview of the physical structure of the Feup-reUSE software system using a UML deployment diagram (Deployment View).

Feup-reUSE is deployed on the user's smartphone. The application securely stores login data and other user information utilizing Firebase, a robust backend platform. This ensures seamless authentication and data management functionalities.

Moreover, Feup-reUSE has access to the local files stored on the user's smartphone. This access enables the application to upload photos for creating posts and to update the user's profile picture.

### Vertical prototype
For the Vertical Prototype, we focused on implementing the search user functionality. This feature was chosen due to its simplicity and its seamless integration between the backend, frontend, and Firebase.
